## Task1 - [Shevchenko's poem(team task).](https://github.com/ShulzhenkoA/JavaExternal_team_tasks/tree/master/tasks/poem) [Draw a figure(team task).](https://github.com/ShulzhenkoA/JavaExternal_team_tasks/tree/master/tasks/geometrical.figures/src/com/java/external)

## Task2 - [GuessTheNumber (Gaming Java with MVC pattern)](https://github.com/ShulzhenkoA/JavaExternal/tree/master/JavaGaming/src/com/javaextetnal_shulzhenko/gaming/GuessTheNumber)
The program generates a random number from 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive), which is proposed to guess the player with 6 attempts. Entering non-numbers and numbers outside the range is considered as an attempt. To exit the game, enter the 'quit' command.

## Task3 - [DroidsWar](https://github.com/ShulzhenkoA/JavaExternal/tree/master/DroidsWar/src/org/javaexternal_shulzhenko/game)
The **DroidsWar** program allows you to create droids of different strengths, giving them different weapons, as well as create non-combat droids (for example, droids for repair). 

In **DroidsWar**, you can simulate the battle between created droids. 

The logic of battle between droids is based on:
- the strength of the weapon used by the droid;
- dynamic generation of droid protection during the battle (the greater the protection of the droid, the greater the probability and amount of reflected damage);
- number of hit points.

The program shows an example of building class hierarchies.
